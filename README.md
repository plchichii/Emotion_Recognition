***OVERVIEW***

This project uses the FER2013 dataset to build a model for emotion recognition based on facial expressions. The model classifies emotions such as happy, sad, surprised, fear, etc using ArcFace for face feature extraction and EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone model for classification.
Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- pandas
- numpy

***DATASET***

The FER2013 dataset is used for training and testing. It includes facial expression images with labels for different emotions.
